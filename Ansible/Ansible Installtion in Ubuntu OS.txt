Ansible Installation Steps on Ubuntu OS
======================================

Note: Remote-Server-Pre-Requisites:
===============================
1)Remote user has been created
2)Added into sudoers file and adm group 
3)Enabled password-based authentication set to yes

1)Update the current user password

sudo passwd  <current user>

2)create user and password needs to be set

sudo adduser <username>

3)Add the user into sudoers file

sudo visudo

<current user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
<new user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

4)enable the password-based authentication is set to yes

sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config 

****restart the sshd service*****

sudo service sshd restart 

*******check whether the service is restarted or not comparing the timestamp************

sudo service sshd status

5)Switch to created user:

sudo su - <new user>

6)Install Ansible and Check the version of ansible

sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt install ansible -y
ansible --version

7)Create SSH Keys and copy the public key on to the remote server

ssh-keygen
			
*********copy the public key on to the remote server**************

ssh-copy-id remote-user@remote server private IP address

8)Create host file the user home directory and provide ownership as well

sudo cd ~

sudo touch hosts.txt

sudo chown -R <new user>:<new user> *

sudo vi hosts

*** ADD the remote server Private IP address under which group you want to add this server*******
		
9)Letâ€™s try to check the connectivity from the ansible using ping module

ansible all -i  ./hosts -u <remote-user> -m ping

O/P:
		/*
		<your remote server IP Address> | SUCCESS => {
		"ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
		},
		"changed": false,
		"ping": "pong"
		}
